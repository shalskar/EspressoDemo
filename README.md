# EspressoDemo

### Description
This project consists of a single screen mimicking a form with various types of entry fields (free-form text, toggle, dialog with options). 

A bunch of different automated Espresso UI tests will be created for this screen to ensure that each entry field works correctly, validates correctly and that state persists across configuration changes.
